# dotfiles

These are the config files I use to set up my system.

This is, and always will be, a work in progress. Especially currently, as I am still in the process of adding my configuration files to this repository.

### Installation

Clone the repo to your system:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/connorjacobsen/dotfiles
```

Run the install script:

```bash
$ chmod u+x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

The install script is pretty simple, so if you don't trust me, you can read through it pretty quickly.

### Notes

- If you use `bash` as your default shell, I have no idea how much of this will still work.
- Some things are still hard-coded for my system / directory setup. Ideally I would like to make the setup more agnostic to a given directory layout or operating system.
